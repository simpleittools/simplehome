# Simple Home

Simple Home is a system to collect all documentation, repair manuals, warranty info, maintenance schedules, and maintenance history for a home.

Additionally, an inventory function will be added to the system. This makes it easier to catalog the information about the items you acquire.

This is written with a combination of Go (Gofiber and Gorm) and VueJS 3. As written the Project has the driver for Postgres. To see other database drivers, please check out https://gorm.io/docs/connecting_to_the_database.htm
